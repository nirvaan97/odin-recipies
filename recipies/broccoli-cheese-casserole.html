    <h2>Veggies Under Cheese</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe that is a family staple for all of our holidays. I misplaced my recipe and was thankful to find
        it here. However, the preparation for our recipe is different, and it does make a difference in the finished
        dish. Some of the ingredients are a tad different as well. First, we blanch and drain the broccoli. I think
        leaving out this step is why some of your dishes are coming out runny, it also makes the color appearance much
        better. Also, we use slightly less mayo, about 3/4 cup, more cheese (12 oz or 3 cups) and no salt or pepper.
        There is enough salt already in the soup. Also, we mix the broccoli into the soup mixture. Bake 45 minutes, and
        then top with finely smashed cheese crackers and return to oven for another 15 minutes or until cheese cracker
        crust is brown. It is awesome!

    <p>This is the best broccoli cheese casserole I have ever tasted. My husbands family is big on broccoli cheese
        casserole, but this beat their usual great tasting casserole. It was a hit at Christmas. I used the suggestion
        of 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 c. sour cream and extra cheese. I also omitted the added salt and pepper and it was
        great! The condensed soups and cheese have a salty enough flavor that no extra was needed.Thanks for this
        recipe, I will pass it on.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup onions, chopped</li>
        <li>3 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped broccoli</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 dash paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>


        <li><strong>Step1</strong>
            <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step2</strong>
            <p>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together condensed soup, mayonnaise, egg and onions.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step3</strong>
            <p>Place frozen broccoli into a very large mixing bowl. (I like to use my large stainless steel bowl to
                mix this recipe thoroughly.) Break up the frozen broccoli. Using a rubber spatula, scrape
                soup-mayonnaise mixture on top of broccoli, and mix well. Sprinkle on cheese, and mix well. Spread
                mixture into prepared baking dish, and smooth top of casserole. Season with salt, pepper and
                paprika.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step4</strong>
            <p> Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
