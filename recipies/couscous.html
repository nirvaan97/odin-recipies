        This recipe is excellent. Instead of the dehydrated sundried tomatoes, I used the ones sitting in olive oil at the antipasto section. They were way better. I still soaked them in the water, and the added oil added a ton of flavour, while keeping the tomatoes very soft. And the recipe says to use half a box of couscous, which can be confusing. I buy my couscous from the bulk food store (its WAY cheaper), so I used a ratio of 2 parts liquid to 1 part couscous, i.e. used 3/4 a cup of couscous with the 1 1/2 cups of water

        There's not enough liquid when sauteing the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic. Keep lemon juice to a minimum but add extra water from time to time, just to keep veggies moist; it will evaporate. Otherwise, a tasty and healthy recipe.
